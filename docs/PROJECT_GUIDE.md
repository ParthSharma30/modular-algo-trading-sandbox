# Cloud Algorithmic Trading Sandbox: Project Guide

## What is This Project?

The Cloud Algorithmic Trading Sandbox is a modular, cloud-ready platform for building, testing, and simulating algorithmic trading strategies. It is designed for educational, research, and experimental use, allowing users to safely develop and evaluate trading ideas using synthetic or historical financial data in a scalable, containerized environment.

## Why Does It Exist?

- **Education**: To help students, hobbyists, and professionals learn about algorithmic trading, quantitative finance, and software engineering in a safe, sandboxed environment.
- **Experimentation**: To provide a flexible platform for testing new trading strategies without risking real capital.
- **Research**: To enable rapid prototyping and evaluation of trading algorithms using real or simulated data.
- **Cloud-Native**: To demonstrate best practices in building scalable, containerized, and cloud-deployable financial applications.

## High-Level Architecture

```
User
 │
 ▼
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
 │  ▲
 │  │ WebSocket (real-time updates)
 ▼  │
Backend (Spring Boot, Java)
 │
 ▼
Database (PostgreSQL)

Market Data Engine (Simulated/API)
```

- **Frontend**: User interface for authentication, strategy management, simulation controls, and real-time visualization.
- **Backend**: Handles authentication, strategy execution, order management, portfolio tracking, and exposes REST/WebSocket APIs.
- **Database**: Stores user data, strategies, portfolios, and trade history.
- **Market Data Engine**: Simulates or fetches market data for use in backtesting and live simulation.

## Component Roles

- **React Frontend**: Provides dashboards, forms, and charts for users to interact with the system.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Implements business logic, security, and API endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Persists all relevant data.
- **Market Data Engine**: Supplies price data for strategies.

## User Journey & Workflow

1. **Registration & Login**
   - Users sign up and log in via the frontend. JWT tokens are used for secure authentication.

2. **Strategy Management**
   - Users can create, upload, or select trading strategies (in JSON format) through the dashboard.
   - Strategies are validated and stored in the backend.

3. **Simulation & Backtesting**
   - Users choose between backtesting (historical data) or live simulation (synthetic/streamed data).
   - The backend executes the strategy logic, simulates order placement, and tracks portfolio performance.

4. **Visualization**
   - Results (P&L, trades, charts) are streamed to the frontend in real time via WebSocket.
   - Users can analyze performance and iterate on strategies.

## Example Strategy Format

```json
{
  "name": "Moving Average Crossover",
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "parameters": {
    "shortPeriod": 10,
    "longPeriod": 30,
    "positionSize": 100
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "condition": "short_ma > long_ma",
      "action": "BUY",
      "quantity": "positionSize"
    },
    {
      "condition": "short_ma < long_ma",
      "action": "SELL",
      "quantity": "ALL"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security & Sandboxing

- **JWT Authentication**: All API endpoints are protected.
- **Strategy Sandboxing**: User strategies are validated and executed in a restricted environment to prevent malicious code execution.
- **Input Validation**: All user input is sanitized.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of API endpoints.

## Deployment & Extensibility

- **Dockerized**: All components are containerized for easy deployment.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Can be deployed on AWS, ECS, or any cloud provider supporting Docker.
- **Modular**: Easily extendable with new data sources, strategies, or analytics modules.
